This project is a clone of the Pinterest user interface (UI), developed in React Native. The goal is to provide developers with a solid foundation to understand and implement the key features of Pinterest in a mobile application.

## Features

## Technologies Used 
- React Native: The primary framework for developing the mobile application.
- Expo: Platform used to create and manage the React Native development environment.
- React Navigation: Library for navigating between screens and managing routes.
- GestureHandler: This library provides a set of components and APIs for handling touch interactions and gestures in React Native applications.
